        Coming from a town in Ocean County, NJ,
        Tyler Sharif started Sharif Landscaping
        as a small side job to make a few extra bucks.
        He grew up loving to work outside and get his hands
        dirty, so he decided to start by helping out family
        members and friends with small and simple jobs
        they needed done around the house. He loved the type
        of work that he was doing, so he decided to
        try and get even more business. Being able to help out
        people in the area with work they can't, don't
        know how, or don't have the time to do is rewarding
        enough, but meeting new people and getting to know
        your own community makes it worth it.

        As of right now, he partnered up with his brother
        Chris hoping to be able to help out even more
        people around the area. The position that
        Sharif Landscaping is in right now is great, however,
        some services are limited due to not having certain
        equipment at this time. There is hope that soon
        enough, more services will become available for
        the people in need.

        Coming from both Tyler and Chris, we very much
        appreciate working with every client that there
        has been. We hope to eventually build a team of
        great people to help out even more people. Thank
        you so much for allowing us to grow and we hope
        to hear from you again in the future!
